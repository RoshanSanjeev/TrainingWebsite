        <h4><i><b>What is Massing and who fits into this category?</b></i></h4>
        <p> A majority of the population will fall under htis category 
            due to the population containing lots of skinny and skinny-fat people.
            Skinny fat is a term deemed to people that have a good amount of fat mass 
            while having little muscle. The priority will be to put on muscle mass for these people
            then focus their energy on losing fat later down the line. The reason we do not try to do both
            at the same time is because it putting too many eggs in different baskets.
            The most productive resluts are usually yielded by either committing to a cut or a bulk(massing).
