        <h4><b><i>What is Fat loss/Cutting/Body Recomp and who fits into this category?</i></b></h4>
        <p>Fat loss, Cutting, and Body Recomp all mean the same thing in my eyes.
            The goal of losing body fat should be to maintain and even build muscle while losing body fat.
            Granted while losing body fat the rate at which you gain muscle will slow down according
            to all data out there, unless you hold extreme amounts of fat. This is why if you are new to the gym
            it is recommended to put on muscle first as it is a much slower process than losing fat, and if you were
            to enter a fat loss phase the rate that was already slow in the first place would be even slower.        
        </p>
