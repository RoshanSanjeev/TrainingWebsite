                        <p>Hi my name is Roshan Sanjeev and I come from the Bay Area, specifically Fremont. I have a deep passion
                        for helping people towards their body building goals as I know the mass effects it has on more than just the appearance
                        It is my mission to provide on demand coaching for those in need at reasonable prices. In my personal journey I struggled
                        to find what work and it took me three years to really transform myself. I say this not as a negative, but as a strength because
                        I had to work much harder than the average joe to gain the physique I had. Constant readjustments in my day to day workout plan
                        , numerous methods experienced with, and different mindsets during this time has made me prepared in order to face any porblem that clinets may hav with themselves.
                        Join me and 6 other happy clients in your journey to transform yourself.
                        <br>
                        My prices are $116 for 1 year of coaching with access to my 
                        personal phone number given through email once deposit has been made.
